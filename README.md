# About The Project

### Welcome to the React Employees!

Ð¡utting-edge web application that streamlines employee management for your business. Built using the latest web technologies including Express, TypeScript, React, and Prisma, React-Employees offers a comprehensive suite of features to simplify your workforce management process.

### Key Features

**User Authentication with JWT:** Leveraging JSON Web Tokens (JWT), React-Employees implements a secure user authentication system. Upon login, JWT tokens are issued and utilized for subsequent authorized API requests.

**Employee CRUD Operations:** The application demonstrates full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for employee records. Prisma models are employed to define the schema and structure of employee data.

**Registration and Login Flow:** New users can register by providing necessary details, and registered users can log in securely. The frontend communicates with the backend to handle authentication and token management.

**Dynamic Form Handling:** React forms are intelligently designed to handle input validation and provide a seamless user experience. Form components are modular and reusable, reducing redundancy in code.
